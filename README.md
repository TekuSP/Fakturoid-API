# Fakturoid API C#/.NET client

This projects aims to create C#/.NET client for API of Czech online accounting service [Fakturoid](http://www.fakturoid.cz).

Please note that some more obscure functions are not (yet) supported - like API access to generators, reports etc. I'll implement them once I would need them, or you can do it in your fork (I accept pull request). The infrastructure is all here.

The library is developed in C#, uses _[Microsoft ASP.NET Web API Client Libraries](http://www.asp.net/web-api)_ (NuGet: `Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi.Client`) and conforms to .NET Standard 2.0 - therefore you can use it both in .NET Framework 4.x and .NET5.

Since version 2.5, the library exposes fully asynchronnous Task-based API for use with `async` and `await`.

## How to use in your project

Install current version of library as a NuGet package `Altairis.Fakturoid.Client` from the [NuGet Gallery](http://www.nuget.org):

    install-package Altairis.Fakturoid.Client

## Upgrade from version 1.x


Current version supports [Fakturoid API v2](http://docs.fakturoid.apiary.io/). 

The only **breaking change** from v1 is that constructor of `FakturoidContext` class now requires the `email` argument as well and that its `AuthenticationName` arg and property was renamed to `AccountName` to avoid confusion.

## Documentation

* Look into the `Altairis.Fakturoid.Client.DemoApp` project for usage.
* All public members have XML documentation that will show up in IntelliSense.
* The [API Reference](API-Reference.md) is available.
